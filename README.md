FLAMES Chatbot is powered by the Google Generative AI APIâ€”the same technology behind Google Gemini. By integrating artificial intelligence into the program, I aimed to make it more useful, interactive, relevant, and genuinely helpful for students. I developed this chatbot during my first year, first semester, as part of my coursework for the subject Computer Programming. It was one of my earliest projects and a great introduction to building practical applications using AI.
